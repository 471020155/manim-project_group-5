Manim animations project
# Overview

This project provides educational animations explaining key concepts in electromagnetics and how they are connected, from electric fields to currents in capacitors.

-Topics & Order

⁂ Electric Field

Electric field intensity and force.

Electric flux and Gauss’s Law.

Relation between enclosed charge and flux through a closed surface.

⁂ Displacement Field (𝐃)

Definition of the electric displacement field.

External vs. internal electric fields in materials.

Effect of polarization on the net electric field.

⁂ Polarization

Charge separation in dielectrics under an external field.

Types of polarization:

Electronic

Ionic

Orientation 

⁂ Current in a Capacitor

Capacitor behavior in DC and AC circuits.

Maxwell’s displacement current.

Continuity of current in regions without charge flow.
